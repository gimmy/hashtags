# Hashtags
## Project for Algoritmi e Strutture Dati (2012/13).

Details [here](http://didawiki.cli.di.unipi.it/doku.php/matematica/asd/asd_12/progetto_12) (in Italian).

Tweets analyser: it takes a Tweet list (from text file containg JSON Tweets), 
and looks for Hashtags. It returns Tweets, with Authors, 
in whitch Hashtag occurs (both explicit - with # - and implicit).

*Implicit* occurrence means a Tweet that contains the word - without # - 
by an author quoted by another who has used the word as a hashtag.

### Compile
- Run `make` to compile;
- Run `make clean` to remove compiled files;
- Use `./source/main tweet_file.json`.
